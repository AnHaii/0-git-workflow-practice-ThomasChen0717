Here is an interesting [article](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/07/26/the-hardest-problem-in-computer-science/) I found. This blog post delves into one of the most fundamental yet challenging problems in computer science: naming. It explores how different programming languages, each with their own history and quirks, use overlapping and often confusing terminology to describe core concepts like arrays, pointers, and functions. The inconsistency can create confusion, even among experienced developers, especially when transitioning between languages like C, Python, or JavaScript.This post interests me because it sheds light on the broader issue of semantics and how, even with similar underlying ideas, the terminology across languages can make a huge difference in understanding and communication within the developer community. 

P.S. Eevee is cute. 

## Comment from An Hai
This article gave me a lot to think about. For me, compared to the content and logic of the code, naming seemed to be the least important task, which led to my lack of understanding in this area. This article made me realize that proper naming can help make code easier to maintain, and made me start to value this aspect.

 # Summary 
This article discusses the declining trend in employment rates for software developers in the U.S. Since 2018, the number of developers has decreased despite their demand surge at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Software developers pay growth has increased over the years, but its growth has lagged behind compared to overall U.S workers. The website also talks about regional pay disparities, like the highest pay being in Silicon Valley, as well as pay growth in areas like Salt Lake City and Orlando.
